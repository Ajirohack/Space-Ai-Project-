## **1. Project Overview**

Space WH is a **membership-based** system with a **restricted registration process** and an AI-driven user engagement model. It integrates a **customized registration portal**, a **member dashboard**, and various **in-house features** for members. The project includes:

- **Invitation-based registration**
- **AI-assisted onboarding**
- **QR & PIN authentication**
- **A local AI-driven assistant**
- **A secure in-house database & communication system**
- **Future scalability with barcode & membership card integration**

---

## **2. Core System Components**

### **2.1 Membership Registration System**

A **restricted registration system** where users can only sign up via an **invitation code** sent to them by the admin.

### **Process Flow**

1. **Invitation Code Generation:**
    - The **admin** generates a **unique alphanumeric** **Invitation Code** (15-20 characters).
    - The code is **pre-registered with the invited personâ€™s full name**.
    - It is sent via **email or QR code** with a **4-digit PIN**.
2. **QR Code & PIN Authentication:**
    - Users **scan** the QR code to open the **registration page**.
    - The page is **blurred out** until the **4-digit PIN** is entered.
    - Once validated, the **AI-assisted registration process** begins.
3. **AI-Assisted Registration (Voice Interaction):**
    - A **local AI model (AutoGPT/Ollama)** engages the invited user in a **voice conversation**.
    - The AI asks the userâ€™s **full name** (to match the Invitation Code).
    - The AI **explains rules, regulations, policies, and membership conditions**.
    - At the end, the AI asks for **verbal consent to accept the invitation**.
    - The user's response and details are **submitted to the admin for review**.
4. **Offline Approval & Membership Code Issuance:**
    - The **admin manually approves the registration offline**.
    - Upon approval, a **Membership Code** is issued to the new member.
    - The Membership Code is **sent via email or another communication method**.
    - The **new member can now download the Space WH App**.

---

### **2.2 Member Dashboard (Membership Hub)**

After successful onboarding, members access the **Membership Hub** (or **Dashboard/Panel**), which serves as the central **interface for Space WH features**.

### **Access Control Flow**

- The member logs in using their **Membership Code**.
- The system validates the Membership Code and grants **limited access** (until full initiation).
- After **Complete Initiation**, the user gets **full access** to Space WH features.

### **Key Features in the Membership Hub**

- **Dashboard Overview:** Displays membership status, notifications, and available tools.
- **AI Assistance:** Integrated **local AI model** for inquiries and automated processes.
- **Secure Communication:** Access to the **In-House email system** (for members only).
- **File Storage & Reports:** Secure document storage for **APP Review Reports** and other member-exclusive files.
- **QR & Barcode Integration:** The **Membership Key** is embedded in a **QR/Bar Code** for instant access.
- **Event & Log Tracking:** Logs all **user actions, database events, and interactions**.
- **Future Expansion Features:** Supports future modules such as **collaborative tools, voting, and discussions**.

---

## **3. Security & Authentication Mechanisms**

Since Space WH operates on a **restricted invitation system**, it requires strong **security measures** to prevent unauthorized access.

### **3.1 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

- The **Invitation Code + Name Verification** acts as the first layer of authentication.
- The **4-digit PIN** (sent with the QR code) serves as a second-layer verification.
- The **Membership Code** ensures that only accepted members can log in.
- **QR/Barcode Login (Future Plan):** Users can scan their membership cards for instant login.

### **3.2 Offline Authentication Handling**

- The final acceptance of a new member happens **offline**, ensuring additional security.
- The **Membership Key** is generated **only after manual verification**.

---

## **4. AI Integration (Local GPT Model)**

### **4.1 AI for Registration & Onboarding**

- A **locally hosted AI model** (like AutoGPT, Ollama, or a fine-tuned LLM) handles **voice-based registration**.
- The AI interacts with users, explains policies, and collects their **verbal consent** before submission.
- This removes the need for users to **type long Invitation Codes manually**.

### **4.2 AI for Ongoing Assistance**

- Inside the Membership Hub, the AI serves as a **personal assistant** for:
    - Answering **membership-related** questions.
    - Explaining **rules and policies**.
    - Assisting with **document storage and retrieval** (like APP Review Reports).

---

## **5. Database & In-House Email System**

### **5.1 Membership Database**

A structured **database setup** is required to manage:

- **Member Profiles:** Name, Membership Code, Initiation Status, etc.
- **Invitation Code Tracking:** Which codes were issued and to whom.
- **Login & Access Logs:** Security tracking of all user actions.

### **5.2 In-House Email System**

- A **private, locally-run email server** for **internal communication**.
- Allows members to communicate **securely within the network**.
- Prevents external parties from accessing sensitive member communications.

---

## **6. Future Development Plans**

### **6.1 Membership QR/Bar Code Cards**

- Physical **membership cards** with an **embedded QR/Bar Code**.
- Scanning the card grants **instant access to the Membership Hub**.
- Includes a **4-digit PIN** for added security.

### **6.2 Encrypted & Changing Registration Links**

- Registration links are **dynamically encrypted** and **change frequently** to prevent unauthorized access.
- Ensures that only **invited members** can reach the registration page.

### **6.3 More AI Features**

- AI-driven **document summarization and search** for stored reports.
- **Voice-controlled commands** inside the Membership Hub.

---

## **7. Technical Stack Recommendations**

### **7.1 Backend**

- **Node.js/Python (FastAPI or Django)** for backend logic.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** for the membership database.
- **Self-hosted email server (e.g., Postfix, Mailu)** for the in-house email system.

### **7.2 Frontend**

- **React.js / Next.js** for a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **WebRTC & Speech Recognition API** for AI-driven voice interaction.

### **7.3 AI & Security**

- **Locally hosted GPT model (Ollama, AutoGPT, or custom LLM)**
- **AES-256 encryption** for QR/PIN authentication.
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure session management.
