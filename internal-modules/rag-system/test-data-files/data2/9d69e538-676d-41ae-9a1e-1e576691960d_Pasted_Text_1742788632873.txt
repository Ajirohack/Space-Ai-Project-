## Development Steps

Here’s a structured plan to develop the **Membership Initiation System (MIS)** for **Space WH**, following the requirements and phases outlined in your documentation. This plan ensures clarity, security, and alignment with the project’s goals.

---

### **1. Project Objectives**

- Create a secure, AI-driven membership registration system for Space WH.
- Ensure **exclusive access** via invitation codes, PINs, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Enable **voice/text-based onboarding** with AI verification.
- Provide an admin interface for code generation, user review, and approval.

---

### **2. Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Core Functionality (2-3 Weeks)**

**Deliverables:**

- **User Interface (UI):**
    - **Invitation Code Entry:** A simple form for users to input their invitation code and PIN.
    - **AI-Assisted Onboarding:**
        - Voice/text input for name verification.
        - Policy explanation via AI (text-to-speech/speech-to-text).
        - Consent confirmation (voice/text).
    - **Blurred Content Lock:** Hide onboarding steps until PIN is validated.
- **Admin Interface (Basic):**
    - Generate invitation codes with names/PINs.
    - Review user submissions (basic dashboard).
    - Approve/reject applications and issue membership codes.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript (existing code) + Voice API (e.g., Web Speech API).
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express.js (or Python Flask) for API endpoints.
- **Database:** MySQL/MongoDB to store invitation codes, user data, and membership keys.

---

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Security & Features (1-2 Weeks)**

**Deliverables:**

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    - Integrate 2FA (e.g., Google Authenticator or SMS).
    - Add biometric verification (optional).
- **Voice Authentication:**
    - Use a speech-to-text API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe).
    - Store voice samples securely for future verification.
- **Admin Dashboard Enhancements:**
    - Real-time analytics for user submissions.
    - Bulk code generation and export/import features.
    - Audit logs for all admin actions.

**Tech Stack:**

- **APIs:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Rekognition (for voice/biometrics).
- **Security:** HTTPS, encryption for sensitive data (e.g., AES-256), rate-limiting.

---

### **Phase 3: Final Testing & Deployment (1 Week)**

**Deliverables:**

- **Security Audits:**
    - Penetration testing for vulnerabilities.
    - Compliance checks (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    - Test end-to-end workflow with beta users.
    - Fix bugs and UX issues.
- **Deployment:**
    - Host on a secure cloud platform (AWS, Azure).
    - Set up SSL certificates and load balancing.

---

### **3. Key Features Breakdown**

### **User Experience (UI):**

1. **Invitation Code Entry:**
    - Form with fields for invitation code and PIN.
    - Validation via backend API.
    - Error messages for invalid inputs.
2. **AI Onboarding Flow:**
    - Voice/text input for name verification (AI checks against invitation code).
    - Policy playback (text-to-speech) and consent confirmation.
    - "Submit" button to send data to admins.
3. **Post-Onboarding:**
    - Confirmation screen with instructions to check email for membership codes.

### **Admin Experience (UI):**

1. **Code Generation:**
    - Generate unique invitation codes linked to user names/PINs.
    - Export codes as CSV/QR codes.
2. **User Review:**
    - Dashboard to view pending submissions.
    - Approve/reject buttons with notes.
    - Issue membership codes upon approval.

---

### **4. Security Requirements**

- **Data Encryption:**
    - All user data (voice samples, names, PINs) stored encrypted.
    - Use OAuth 2.0 for API authentication.
- **Access Control:**
    - Role-based access for admins (e.g., "Super Admin" vs. "Code Generator").
    - Two-factor authentication for admin login.
- **Compliance:**
    - GDPR/CCPA compliance for data handling.
    - Regular backups and disaster recovery plans.

### **5. Timeline (Total: 4-6 Weeks)**

| **Phase** | **Duration** | **Key Milestones** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1: Core Features** | 2 weeks | Functional UI/UX, basic admin tools, PIN verification, AI onboarding simulation. |
| **Phase 2: Security & Enhancements** | 2 weeks | MFA integration, voice API implementation, advanced admin dashboard. |
| **Phase 3: Testing & Deployment** | 1 week | Security audits, UAT, deployment to production. |

---

### **6. Risk Management**

- **Technical Risks:**
    - **Voice API Delays:** Use fallback text input if voice APIs fail.
    - **Security Breaches:** Regular penetration testing and encryption audits.
- **User Experience Risks:**
    - **Confusing Workflow:** Conduct usability testing with mockups.
    - **Language Barriers:** Support multilingual voice/text inputs.

---

### **7. Next Steps**

1. **Prototype:** Build a clickable mockup of the UI (e.g., Figma).
2. **Backend Setup:** Initialize the database and API endpoints.
3. **Voice API Integration:** Test speech-to-text functionality.
4. **Admin Dashboard:** Develop the core admin interface.
