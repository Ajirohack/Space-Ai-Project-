The Five Stages of a Well-Executed Scam

A successful con artist follows a structured progression to ensure maximum control, trust, and financial exploitation of the victim. Below is the breakdown of each stage, including objectives, tactics, and real-world examples.

1. TARGET SELECTION

(Who & Why?)

Objective:

Identify an individual (or group) who is psychologically, emotionally, or financially vulnerable. The ideal target must have access to resources and a high susceptibility to manipulation.

Key Tactics:

Psychological Profiling: Observing social media, dating profiles, or professional status to identify lonely, desperate, or naive individuals.

Demographic Targeting: Choosing individuals based on age, gender, financial stability, and emotional state.

Vulnerability Scanning: Seeking those who recently lost loved ones, divorced, retired, or are seeking companionship or investment opportunities.

Environment Selection: Using high-trust environments such as dating apps, social clubs, churches, and business networking platforms to find ideal victims.

Real-World Example:

🔹 Simon Leviev targeted women on Tinder, selecting those who showed signs of wanting serious relationships and had financial means.

2. TRUST BUILDING

(How to Make the Target Feel Safe?)

Objective:

Create an emotional or professional bond strong enough that the victim lowers their skepticism and opens up. The goal is to eliminate doubt.

Key Tactics:

✔ Mirroring & Emotional Bonding: Adopting the victim’s language, interests, and aspirations to form a deep connection.
✔ Fake Credibility: Using fake wealth, business ventures, or elite social connections to appear successful.
✔ Love Bombing & Compliments: Overwhelming the victim with love, attention, and grand romantic gestures (romance scams).
✔ Exclusivity & Urgency: Making the victim feel special or part of a select group (“I don’t tell anyone else this, but I trust you”).
✔ Seeding the Future: Talking about future plans, potential investments, marriage, or business opportunities to keep the victim invested.

Real-World Example:

🔹 Anna Delvey convinced New York’s elite she was a wealthy German heiress, using lavish hotel stays and expensive restaurant bills (paid by others) to reinforce her credibility.

🔹 Bernie Madoff built trust by positioning himself as a respected financial expert, leveraging his Wall Street reputation.

3. MANIPULATION & CONDITIONING

(How to Make the Target Compliant?)

Objective:

Subtly reprogram the victim’s decision-making so they trust and prioritize the con artist above their own judgment or external opinions.

Key Tactics:

✔ Gaslighting & Cognitive Dissonance: Confusing the victim by subtly contradicting their perceptions (e.g., “You’re overthinking it, trust me”).
✔ Fake Proofs: Showing Photoshopped bank accounts, fake invoices, staged phone calls with “investors” or “authorities” to add realism.
✔ Emotional Manipulation: Using pity stories (sick parent, threats, war, fraud victim claims) to make the victim emotionally invested.
✔ Fear & Secrecy: Warning the victim not to tell others because “they wouldn’t understand” or “it’s a confidential deal”.
✔ Escalating Small Requests to Big Demands: Getting the victim to agree to small favors first, then slowly increasing the stakes (e.g., “Can you cover this small expense?”).

Real-World Example:

🔹 Simon Leviev’s “Enemies Are After Me” Scam → He pretended to be in danger, making victims take out loans in their name to “save” him.

🔹 Charles Ponzi’s High-Yield Scheme → He built confidence by paying early investors to make the scam appear legitimate, convincing new investors to pour in more money.

4. EXPLOITATION (The Scam)

(How to Extract Maximum Money?)

Objective:

Make the victim willingly hand over money, assets, or investments without suspecting fraud.

Key Tactics:

✔ Urgency & High-Stress Triggers: Forcing fast decisions with false emergencies (e.g., “I need this money in 24 hours or I’m dead”).
✔ Loan Pushing & Debt Manipulation: Convincing the victim to take out loans, liquidate savings, or borrow from family/friends.
✔ Compounding Requests: Continuously increasing the amount needed once the victim is financially and emotionally invested.
✔ Luxury Illusion Reinforcement: Maintaining the fake rich lifestyle (private jets, designer clothes) using the victim’s own money.
✔ Fake Payback Promises: Offering fake contracts, postdated checks, or false repayment assurances to keep victims at ease.

Real-World Example:

🔹 Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi Scheme – Kept investors happy by showing fake account statements that made them believe they were getting rich, preventing withdrawals.

🔹 Simon Leviev’s Girlfriend Debt Scam – Encouraged women to take credit cards and loans, promising to pay them back, then disappeared.

5. EXIT & ESCAPE STRATEGY

(How to Leave Without Getting Caught?)

Objective:

End the scam without raising suspicion or giving victims time to react.

Key Tactics:

✔ Ghosting & Sudden Disappearance: Cutting off contact entirely after extracting maximum funds (e.g., changing phone numbers, blocking victims).
✔ Blame External Factors: Pretending to be arrested, kidnapped, deported, or forced to flee (so the victim doesn’t report fraud immediately).
✔ Fake Payback Excuses: Stringing the victim along with fake repayment stories (e.g., “I will send the money next week, my accounts are frozen”).
✔ Scapegoating a Third Party: Blaming a fake assistant, accountant, business partner for the missing funds.
✔ Setting Up a New Identity: Moving to another country, changing names, and starting the scam over with new victims.

Real-World Example:

🔹 Victor Lustig (The Man Who Sold the Eiffel Tower) → After successfully conning businessmen into “buying” the Eiffel Tower, he fled to Vienna before police could catch on.

🔹 Gerald Blanchard (Master Thief) → He would steal priceless items, replace them with fake copies, then disappear for years before resurfacing with new identities.

Conclusion: Why This Process Works

✔ Each step builds upon the previous one, ensuring the victim isn’t just scammed, but is conditioned to cooperate voluntarily.
✔ The scammer adjusts techniques based on the victim’s reactions, ensuring they remain emotionally and financially trapped.
✔ By the time the victim realizes the fraud, it is too late, the scammer has already vanished.
