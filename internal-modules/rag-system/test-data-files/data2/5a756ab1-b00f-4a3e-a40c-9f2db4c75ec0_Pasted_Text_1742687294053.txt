The Platform is divided into several phases... 
##The first Phase being the membership registration system, which comprises of the an admin portal to generate an Invitation key . and after invited members receives their key, through email, they then proceeded with validating and accepting their invitation.

**### **2.1 Membership Registration (By Invitation Only)**

This phase controls **who can join Space WH**, ensuring exclusivity.

### **ðŸ’¡ Optimized Registration Process**

1. **Invitation Code Issuance (Admin-Generated)**
    - Admin generates a **unique alphanumeric** **Invitation Code** (15-20 chars).
    - Code is **linked to the invited personâ€™s full name**.
    - Sent **via email, QR code, or encrypted link**, along with a **4-digit PIN**.
2. **QR Code & PIN Authentication**
    - User **scans the QR code** (or visits the encrypted link).
    - The page is **blurred out** until the **4-digit PIN** is entered.
    - Once validated, the **AI-assisted onboarding process begins**.
3. **AI-Assisted Onboarding (Voice-Driven)**
    - **AI verifies** the user's **full name** (to match Invitation Code).
    - AI **explains Space WH policies, rules, and responsibilities**.
    - AI **asks for verbal consent** (recorded as part of offline verification).
    - If the user **accepts**, the request is **sent to admin for final approval**.
4. **Offline Verification & Membership Code Issuance**
    - Admin **reviews the AI-captured data**.
    - If approved, the **Membership Code** is sent to the user.
    - The user is now eligible to **download & install the Space WH App**.



Onboarding is a voice interview. So an Ai (Model) will be embedded into that process for the onboarding process .

**Secure Login & Membership Key**

- **Membership Code** â†’ Used for **dashboard login** (until full initiation).
- **Membership Key** â†’ A **permanent unique identifier** stored in the **database**, tracking:
    - **Member actions**
    - **Usage history**
    - **Feature access rights**
    - **Temporary revocation capability


After successful registration, that invitation Key, then permanently get secured by changing it to a Membership Key, which allow the new member to access the SpaceWH, which is the main aim of registration. To get access to the SpaceWH

The SpaceWH (initial version) is like a clean Chat UI, which takes us to the next Phase.
