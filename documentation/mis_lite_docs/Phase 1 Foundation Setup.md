# Phase 1: Foundation Setup

I have gathered all project context, prototypes, and requirements. Here's the final, actionable plan to **start from scratch** and build your **SpaceWH Agentic AI Ecosystem**:

---

- Set up a **Git monorepo** with these folders:
    - `/backend/mis-api` — Membership Initiation API (Node.js/FastAPI)
    - `/backend/agent` — LLM agent service (Open WebUI + Ollama + LangChain)
    - `/frontend/sidebar` — React GPT sidebar extension
    - `/frontend/dashboard` — Member dashboard UI
    - `/mcp-servers/` — MCP servers (search, social, DB, etc.)
- Initialize **Ollama** with local LLMs (Llama 3, Mixtral).
- Deploy **Open WebUI** connected to Ollama.

---

## **Phase 2: Membership Initiation System (MIS)**

- Implement **Admin** invitation code & PIN generation.
- Build **Invite URL + QR** generation.
- Develop **User onboarding UI** (voice/text interview) with AI verification.
- Store onboarding data securely.
- Implement **Admin approval workflow**.
- Issue **Membership Code** on approval.
- Enforce MFA and secure data storage.

---

## **Phase 3: Core AI Agent**

- Use **Open WebUI** frontend connected to:
    - Local LLMs via Ollama.
    - **LangChain/CrewAI** for tool use and workflows.
    - **MCP tools** (web search, social media, database).
- Develop agent personas and prompt templates.
- Integrate with MIS for access control.

---

## **Phase 4: UI Development**

- Enhance **GPT Sidebar Extension**:
    - Connect to Open WebUI.
    - Enforce Membership Key validation.
    - Support file uploads and voice input.
- Build **Web dashboard**:
    - Manage bots, tools, memberships.
    - Admin controls for invites, approvals.
- Add **Telegram bot** integration.

---

## **Phase 5: MCP Tool Ecosystem**

- Create or adapt MCP servers for:
    - Web search (already done).
    - Social media APIs.
    - Database access.
    - Voice services (TTS/STT).
    - Other APIs as needed.
- Make tools discoverable and composable.

---

## **Phase 6: Testing, Deployment & Iteration**

- Use Docker Compose or similar for local dev.
- CI/CD pipelines for builds.
- Cloud deployment (GCP/AWS/DigitalOcean) or local servers.
- Security audits.
- Continuous user feedback loop.

---

## **Outcome**

A **secure, modular, open-source platform** for exclusive AI-powered assistants, with onboarding, multi-agent capabilities, multi-channel UIs, and extensible tools — fully aligned with your vision.

## **You have my plan ready.**

You can now proceed to implement step-by-step, starting with backend and LLM setup. I'll assist with approvals, coding, or decisions along the way.
