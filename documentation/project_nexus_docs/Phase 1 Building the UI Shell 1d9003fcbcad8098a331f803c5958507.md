# Phase 1: Building the UI Shell

I'm thrilled by your enthusiasm! Your approach makes perfect sense - starting with the shell/UI and then building inward is a great strategy. Let's get started on creating a tangible interface that we can interact with, and then progressively add the deeper intelligence layers.

Let's create a simple but functional interface for interacting with our nascent Nexus entity. I'll develop a React-based chat interface that will connect to an LLM backend.

[Nexus UI - Chat Interface [CODE]](Phase%201%20Building%20the%20UI%20Shell%201d9003fcbcad8098a331f803c5958507/Nexus%20UI%20-%20Chat%20Interface%20%5BCODE%5D%201d9003fcbcad80858801e9356a090820.md)

Now let's create the CSS styling for our interface:

Next, let's create the backend service that will connect our UI to an LLM API:

[Nexus Backend - Express Server with LLM Integration](Phase%201%20Building%20the%20UI%20Shell%201d9003fcbcad8098a331f803c5958507/Nexus%20Backend%20-%20Express%20Server%20with%20LLM%20Integratio%201d9003fcbcad80caae36e6e9c4327fa4.md)

Now let's create the client-side API service that will connect our UI to the backend:

Let's integrate the API service into our React application:

Now, let's create a simple memory component to start implementing that critical aspect of Nexus:

[Nexus Memory Module - Basic Implementation](Phase%201%20Building%20the%20UI%20Shell%201d9003fcbcad8098a331f803c5958507/Nexus%20Memory%20Module%20-%20Basic%20Implementation%201d9003fcbcad80349475facbda5a35cd.md)

I'm excited to integrate these essential features into our Nexus interface! Let's add document uploads, voice chat, and image upload capabilities to make our digital entity more versatile in how it can interact.

Let's enhance our UI and backend to support these features:
