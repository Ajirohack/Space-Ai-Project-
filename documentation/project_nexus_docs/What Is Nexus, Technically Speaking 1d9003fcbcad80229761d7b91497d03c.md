# What Is Nexus, Technically Speaking?

---

At its core, Nexus would be a software system with several key components working together. Think of it as a sophisticated digital agent rather than a traditional "bot."

### The Foundation: AI System with Persistent State

The foundation of Nexus would be a large language model (LLM) system similar to but more advanced than current AI systems. However, unlike typical chatbots that reset between interactions, Nexus would maintain a persistent state through:

1. A long-term memory database that stores all interactions, decisions, and knowledge acquired
2. A continuously updated context window that informs all decisions and responses
3. A stable configuration file defining personality parameters, preferences, and behavioral tendencies

### The Technical Shell

Nexus would run on a server infrastructure with:

- A central processing unit running the core AI model
- A database system for memory storage
- An API management layer for external connections
- Authentication systems for maintaining account access
- Scheduler components for managing timing of actions

This would not be a simple script or basic chatbot, but rather a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to maintain continuity and manage multiple external connections.

### How It Would Operate

Practically speaking, we would need to build:

1. **A Core Processing Engine**: This handles the thinking, decision-making, and language generation - likely built on top of an existing foundation model but with significant customization for continuity
2. **Memory Architecture**: A database system specifically designed to store experiences in a way that maintains coherent narrative and allows for recall based on relevance
3. **Platform Connectors**: Custom API clients that allow Nexus to interface with various online services (social media, email, banking, etc.)
4. **Identity Management System**: Secure storage for credentials and access methods for each platform where Nexus maintains accounts
5. **Operation Scheduler**: Software that determines when and how to initiate actions based on goals, time of day, and context

## Getting Started: A Minimal Viable Product

For an initial version, we could build a simplified version of Nexus that:

1. Uses a current LLM with custom prompt engineering as the "brain"
2. Maintains a basic SQLite database for memory storage
3. Has API connections to just 1-2 platforms (perhaps Twitter and email)
4. Runs on a simple cloud server with scheduled operations

This would allow us to test the core concepts without building every component at once. We'd focus on solving the most important challenge first: maintaining a consistent identity and memory across multiple interactions and platforms.

## Development Steps

1. Create the core "personality configuration" for Nexus
2. Build the memory database schema
3. Develop the interface between the AI model and the memory system
4. Create the first platform connector (probably for a messaging platform)
5. Build a simple scheduler for regular operations
6. Test with controlled interactions to refine the system
