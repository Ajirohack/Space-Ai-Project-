# Nexus: Digital Entity Framework

Nexus is a sophisticated digital entity framework designed to maintain a persistent identity, memory, and autonomous capabilities across digital platforms. Unlike traditional AI assistants or chatbots, Nexus maintains a consistent identity and remembers past interactions, creating a more natural and coherent user experience.

## Project Status

This is Phase 1 of the Nexus project, which implements the basic foundation:
- Chat interface with text, voice, document, and image support
- Basic memory system to maintain conversation history
- Personality configuration for consistent identity
- Integration with LLM providers for natural language interaction

## Key Features

- **Persistent Identity**: Maintains consistent personality and behavior across interactions
- **Memory Architecture**: Remembers past conversations and user preferences
- **Multimodal Communication**: Supports text, voice, documents, and images
- **Platform Integration**: Designed to expand across multiple digital platforms
- **LLM Provider Flexibility**: Works with various AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v7.x or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexus.git
   cd nexus
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   ```
   cd server
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` to configure your LLM provider (if using a real API)

4. Start the development servers
   ```
   # In the root directory
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the frontend and backend servers:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
