# Contributing Guidelines

## Important: Private Folders

The following folders are **private** and should **never** be committed or pushed to the repository:

- `developer-folder/` - Contains private development materials
- `documentation/` - Contains private documentation
- `internal-modules/tools-packages/proposed-untested/` - Contains untested or sensitive internal tools/packages

These folders are already added to the `.gitignore` file. Please do not modify this configuration or attempt to commit any content from these directories.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any new code follows the project's coding standards.
2. Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes if applicable.
3. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off from a project maintainer.
